I joined a course in Data Analytics and Data Science, I learned a lot from building interactive dashboards to machine learning, what i feel is that though my B.E. is in mechanical engineering but the field of AI is such that it can be integrated into any existing field, one such example i can give that in automobile sector there are a lot of data the technical specs, ownership, etc, these are very few each for understanding each of this data as mechanical engineer there is a possibility that I would pocess much better knowledge as compared to than that of a person from a complete IT background thus allowing me to gather and use much more releval=nt information, also i have completed my MBA recently which helps me understand much better how business run domestic as well as international",
